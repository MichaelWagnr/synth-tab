                <h3>Roland Juno 106</h3>
                <h4>1983</h4>
                <p>A bandmate of mine purchased a Juno around 2016, that I borrowed for shows. I was really fortunate to
                    have a
                    roommate that was getting rid of a quite damaged Juno around the same time. He sold it to me for
                    $250!
                </p>
                <p>Over the course of several months I replaced just about every part worth replacing while crossing my
                    fingers
                    hoping that it would work.
                </p>
                <p>When I finally plugged it in for the final test the cutoff filter was 100% closed, producing no sound
                    whatsoever. I thought all my attempts were in vain until I noticed the slider position and toggled
                    it
                    open.
                </p>
                <p>I can't say that I did a perfect job restoring it - some keys are unresponsive - but I can plug into
                    it
                    with a midi cable
                    and
                    play
                    it that way.</p>

                <h3>Roland Sh-101</h3>
                <h4>1982</h4>
                <p>I was introduced to electronic music at a young age watching flash animations on the internet circa
                    2000.
                    A number of them had groups like Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada as the soundtrack.</p>
                <p>Around 2014, I was promoted to a managerial position at a warehouse. The pay increase was great and I
                    rewarded myself with a new synthesizer.</p>
                <p>Most vintage polyphonic synths were twice as expensive or more as most vintage monophonic
                    synthesizers.
                    So I popped on eBay and nabbed an SH101.</p>
                <p>It's my favourite synthesizer. It perfectly encapsulates that nostalgic sound of my youth listening
                    to
                    IDM on the early internet.</p>

                <h3>Akai MPC1000</h3>
                <h4>2003</h4>
                <p>A few years into making electronic music, I went deep into samplers. I was possibly more interested
                    in
                    samplers then synthesizers, I certainly am now.</p>
                <p>I used to own a couple rack-mounted Akai s3000xl samplers, which were quite unruly to gig with.</p>
                <p>At a show in Edmonton I watched someone perform a techno P.A. on an Mpc1000. I thought MPCs were
                    strictly
                    used for Hip Hop production.</p>
                <p>I was disapointed to find a huge gap between the functionality between the rack samplers and the
                    Mpc1k.
                    However with the JJOS 2XL firmware update, it transforms into an absolute powerhouse which I
                    primarily
                    use for sampled synth sounds!</p>

                <h3>Elektron Digitakt</h3>
                <h4>2017</h4>
                <p>2019, I went to a show in the garmet district of Montreal. Watching DJ's perform on two decks, I got
                    a
                    weird idea to purchase a second sampler, and a 2 channel mixer with a cross-fader and perform on
                    them as
                    if they were record players.</p>
                <p>I abandonned that idea pretty quickly. However, the grouping of the Mpc1000 and Digitakt proved very
                    advantageous.</p>
                <p>The Digitakt, although often used as a stand-alone sampler, really shines as a drum machine. The
                    Mpc1000,
                    although capable of being a drum machine, has a number of envelopes and polyphony that place it in a
                    category outside of the Digitakt's use-case.</p>
                <p>Both together, incredible.</p>

                <h3>Yamaha DX100</h3>
                <h4>1985</h4>
                <p>FM synthesis. It's a chore to learn how to make sounds with it. I owned a few DX7s and a TX81z at
                    various
                    points.</p>
                <p>I opted for the DX100 because of it's small form-factor. It also has this pretty disctinctive
                    digital-aliasing that makes it sound very gritty.</p>
                <p>There's a video on youtube of someone playing custom patches on the DX100 and a few of them sound a
                    lot
                    like Boards of Canada</p>
                <p>I was able to get really close to the opening pad sound of Boards of Canada's Sunshine Recorder by
                    slightly altering a Pan Flute preset - as I imagine they might have were they to own a DX100. This
                    is
                    quite possible, considering their affinity for flutes and the popularity/availability of the DX100
                    at
                    the time of this songs recording.</p>
